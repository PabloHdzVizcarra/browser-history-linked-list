# Linked Lists

## The Exercise

Linked lists don't get enough love, but they are quite handy data structures, especially you are
unsure about the size or the capacity ahead of time. Are you the kind that has 100 tabs open in your
browser? Well, then you've been using Linked Lists daily. When you press Ctrl + Tab to cycle between
those tabs, you are basically making your way through a circular linked list.
